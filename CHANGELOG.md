# Changelog for `ex_pipeline`
## v0.3.0

### New Features
- Injected functions now have docs

### Fixed
- Fixed misleading type specs

## v0.2.0

### New Features
- Async hooks: functions ending with `_async_hook` will be executed asynchronously, right after steps.
- `Pipeline.State` now tracks the steps that were executed
- The library now exports an application spec, `ex_pipeline`
- Examples were added into some functions
- Updated docs

### Changes
- Callbacks are now called "hooks"
  - They must end with `_hook` instead of `_callback`
- Tests are now async
- The `Pipeline.State.invalidate/2` will now add a generic error message into the state.
- Removed `Pipeline.State.callback/3`
- Removed `errors` from `Pipeline.State` struct, since we only track the last error anyways.
- The callbacks `__pipeline_steps__` and `__pipeline_callbacks` were merged into a single callback, `__pipeline__`
  that returns a tuple with all the information we need.


## v0.1.0
